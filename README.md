# Analysis of results of the Data Science Bowl 2018

The goal of the 2018 DSB was to segment the nucleus of cells in a variety of microscopy images. 
In contrast to previous cell segmentation challenges that requiere methods to be tuned for image 
sets separately, this competition was focused on having a single segmentation model that can blindly 
segment nuclei in 2D light microscopy images, without user interaction. This repository contains
code used for analyzing the result of the competition. A manuscript describing the findings will 
be posted here soon.


The top three participants, according to the official [leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/leaderboard), 
have made their solutions publicly available in the following repositories:

1. [[ods.ai] topcoders](https://github.com/selimsef/dsb2018_topcoders/)
2. [Jacobkie](https://github.com/jacobkie/2018DSB)
3. [Deep Retina](https://github.com/Lopezurrutia/DSB_2018)
